 Overview The Restaurant Billing System is a console-based application developed in C that allows a restaurant to manage customer orders and generate bills efficiently. This program showcases a simple and user-friendly interface where customers can view the menu, place orders, and receive a detailed bill that includes their personal information and the current date and time.  Features Menu Display: Shows a list of available items, including different types of coffee, sandwiches, and snacks, along with their prices. Order Placement: Allows customers to select items from the menu and specify the quantity for each item. Customer Details: Prompts customers to enter their name, address, and contact number (validates that the contact number does not exceed 11 digits). Bill Generation: Provides a detailed bill that includes the customer's name, address, contact number, order details, total amount, and the current date and time. Continuous Operation: After generating a bill, the system resets and is ready to take a new order from the next customer. How It Works Menu Display: The program displays a list of items available for order. Customer Input: The program prompts the customer to enter their personal details (name, address, contact number). Order Process: The customer selects items from the menu, specifies the quantity, and can choose to add more items or finalize the order. Bill Generation: Once the order is complete, the program calculates the total cost and displays a detailed bill including all customer details and the current date and time. Restart: The system then resets, ready to serve the next customer.
